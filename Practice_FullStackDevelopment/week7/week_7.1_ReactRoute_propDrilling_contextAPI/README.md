Routing:
1. Single Page Application  
    -React is a Single Page Application:
    Earlier if we are required to go to linkedin.com, we type it on browser get index.html, index.js and so on from BE
    -if we go to message page , we click on oi, and get again index.html, index.js and so on.
    Its called 'HARD-RELOAD'
    -When React was introduced, it lets us create Single Page Applications
    -It means the very first time i clicked for linked in website- I got index.html, index.js and so on for all pages in one go. 
    -And whenever I changed pages no need for others to get data from BE as it all came in first time.
    -Or there is an optimization , that when u click on like 'messages' tab, u get bundle of data required to load it

3. Client Side Bundle:
    is Bundle that u get from BE- consists of html, css, js that contains data to load every or particular page of website

2. Client side routing:
    the code u wrote for routing
