# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


React is single page app-
when we are changing routes in App, we are just changing view and nor hard-reset
All data including index.js ,html and other files are 
received at first time when html request was made to server


client side bundle:
IIt the data containing html,css,js sent by server . Here, js data contains all data for web-site or app


client side routing
code written by us, to show pages according to the routes
