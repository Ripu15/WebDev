why global variables not used in React
ChatGPT
Global variables are generally avoided in React development for several key reasons related to maintainability, predictability, and the core principles of React. Here are the main reasons why global variables are not commonly used in React:

1. State Management and Predictability
React encourages a unidirectional data flow and component-based architecture. State in React is typically managed within components or through state management libraries like Redux, Context API, or MobX. This approach ensures that the data flow is predictable and easier to trace.

Global Variables Issues:

Unpredictable State Changes: Global variables can be modified from anywhere in the application, leading to unpredictable state changes that are difficult to trace and debug.
Tight Coupling: They create tight coupling between different parts of the application, making the code harder to maintain and reason about.
2. Component Reusability and Isolation
React components are designed to be reusable and encapsulated units of UI. Each component should manage its own state or receive state via props.

Global Variables Issues:

Lack of Isolation: Global variables break the encapsulation of components, making it harder to understand the component's behavior in isolation.
Reusability Concerns: Components relying on global variables are less reusable because they depend on the global context.
3. Testing and Debugging
One of the strengths of React is the ability to easily test components in isolation.

Global Variables Issues:

Testing Difficulty: Global variables make it harder to write unit tests for components, as tests need to account for and manage the global state.
Debugging Complexity: When bugs occur, tracking down the source can be challenging due to the scattered nature of global state changes.
4. Performance
React optimizes rendering and updates efficiently through its virtual DOM and state management techniques.

Global Variables Issues:

Inefficient Updates: Relying on global variables can lead to inefficient updates and re-renders because React's built-in optimization mechanisms are bypassed.
Uncontrolled Side Effects: Global variables can introduce side effects that are not controlled by React's lifecycle methods, leading to performance issues.
Best Practices for State Management in React
To avoid the pitfalls of global variables, React developers typically use the following best practices:

Component State: Manage local state within components using useState or this.setState (in class components).
Context API: For global state management within a React tree, use the Context API. This allows you to create a global state that can be accessed by any component within a context provider.
State Management Libraries: Use libraries like Redux or MobX for more complex state management needs. These libraries provide structured and predictable ways to manage global state.
